## Project Description
This project aims to develop a neural network capable of identifying heartbeat sounds and abnormalities in sounds. The data was obtained from the Kaggle dataset "Heartbeat Sounds" (found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds). This data set contains about 800 .wav files of stethoscope audio recordings from two sources: from the public using the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app and from clinical trials using the Digiscope digital stethoscope. The goal is to create a neural network that can identify heartbeat features present within the recordings. This will place the recordings into the categories: normal, extrasystole (extrastole), extra heartbeat sounds (extrahls), murmur, and artifact. The audio files have varying lengths from 1-30 seconds and contain various levels of noise and artifacts that need to be accounted for before analyzing the files.
