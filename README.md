## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a neural network capable of identifying heartbeat sounds and identifying abnormalities in sounds. The data was obtained from the kaggle dataset "Heartbeat Sounds" (found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kinguistics/heartbeat-sounds). This data set contains about 800 .wav files of stethoscope audio recording from two sources: from the public using the iStethoscope Pro iPhone app and from clinical trials using the Digiscope digital stethoscope. The goal of the project is to create a neural network that can identify heartbeat features present within the recordings. This will place the recordings into the categories: normal, extrasystole (extrastole), extra heartbeat sounds (extrahls), murmur and artifact. The audio files have varying lengths from 1-30 seconds and contain various levels of noise and artifacts that need to be accounted for prior to analyzing the files.
